# History

<Aside>To know where you're going, you need to know where you came from</Aside>

<br />

- Does anyone right now write `require` statements for frontend JS code?
- <Appear>
    Does anyone right now use a script tag in gulp/grunt compiled JS?
  </Appear>
- <Appear>
    Does anyone right now just write JS directly in an HTML file's script tag?

# `import` is the standard now

Everyone's doing it

# Digging deeper...

Let's take a look at

# So we're using `require` in the browser?

<br />

Couldn't be that simple, could it?

<!--
  require is a blocking call - it would block navigation, user input, etc while waiting for that code to be downloaded. a web browser canâ€™t afford to do that
-->

# Wait...

If we aren't using `import`, and we can't use `require`...

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS?

<img src={confusedScreaming} alt="Confused Screaming" />
</Appear>

# Webpack's tranformation

From

```js
import React from "react";
```

<br />

To

```js
"./index.js": function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {
  "use strict";
  __webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__)
  __webpack_require__("./node_modules/react/index.js") // <-----
},
```

<!--
  There's actually a TON more code in that transformation, but that's just the one line we really want to focus on for now.
-->

---

# Turtles all the way down

So our code gets transformed

<br />

`import` -> `require` -> `webpack_require`

<!--
  All before it hits the browser. What we would hope would be running as highly-efficient, fast, performant platform-native code is transformed into non-standard JS code
-->

---

# What's stopping us from using `import`?

<!--
  If we're using require under the hood...
  What makes import better than require?
  Why was there a big shift to use import when require was already working (and is still working)?
  Especially when require still works great in places like NodeJS, where import was only recently (2-ish months ago) released?
-->

<br />

- Browser support?
- NodeJS?
- Inertia?

---

<img src={yesJpeg} alt="Yes" />

<!--
  Browser support and NodeJS support are getting to the point that they won't be factors for much longer though
  Inertia is probably going to be one of the hardest things to overcome, as it is in everything else
-->

---

# Great news

Inertia has recently shifted!
