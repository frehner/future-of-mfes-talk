# What's stopping us from using `import`?

<!--
  If we're using require under the hood...
  What makes import better than require?
  Why was there a big shift to use import when require was already working (and is still working)?
  Especially when require still works great in places like NodeJS, where import was only recently (2-ish months ago) released?
-->

<br />

- Browser support?
- NodeJS?
- Idealogical wars?

# Hypothetically...

## Could we have just used `require` in the browser?

<br />
<Aside>Couldn't be that simple, could it?</Aside>

# Have you seen the problem?

If we aren't using `import`, and we can't use `require`...
