# So we're using `require` in the browser?

<br />

Couldn't be that simple, could it?

<!--
  require is a blocking call - it would block navigation, user input, etc while waiting for that code to be downloaded. a web browser canâ€™t afford to do that
-->

---

# Wait...

If we aren't using `import`, and we can't use `require`...

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS?

<img src={confusedScreaming} alt="Confused Screaming" />
</Appear>

---

# Webpack's tranformation

From

```js
require("react");
```

<br />

To

```js
"./index.js": function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {
  "use strict";
  __webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__)
  __webpack_require__("./node_modules/react/index.js") // <-----
},
```

<!--
  There's actually a TON more code in that transformation, but that's just the one line we really want to focus on for now.
-->

---

# Turtles all the way down

So our code gets transformed

<br />

`import` -> `require` -> `webpack_require`

<!--
  All before it hits the browser. What we would hope would be running as highly-efficient, fast, performant platform-native code is transformed into non-standard JS code
  And to be clear, this is amazing - no sarcasm whatsoever. It's so cool that we can write modern code and have all these sweet tools transform it into something that works
-->

---

# What's stopping us from using `import`?

<!--
  If we're using require under the hood...
  What makes import better than require?
  Why was there a big shift to use import when require was already working (and is still working)?
  Especially when require still works great in places like NodeJS, where import was only recently (2-ish months ago) released?

<!--
  and if I were to summarize the status with two pictures, I would add this one
  let's talk about what's stopping the progress, and how things are going
-->

---

# What's stopping us?

<br />
<Appear>

### Bare import specifiers

</Appear>

---

# Bare... what?

<Appear>
What's the difference between these two import statements?

```js
import Vue from "./vue";
import Vue from "vue";
```

</Appear>

<!--
  the first one tells you exactly where the file for that import lives. It works in both a file-system (NodeJS) and a browser environment
  the second one is a bare import statement - you don't tell the computer exactly where that module lives.

  in Node, you can just assume "look in the node_modules folder for a package named 'react'"

  in a broswer... it says "that's not a URL!" and it dies. browsers must have a URL where they can get things, they don't assume something is at a specific place
-->

---

# Bare Import Specifiers

```js
import Vue from "vue";
```

<br />
<br />

<img
  src={bearImport}
  alt="A bear, with the text 'Bear Imports' below it"
  style={{ height: "250px" }}
/>

<!--
  so it's called 'bare' because it's not a full url
  but the thing is, we have all of our source code written in the second one right?
  and no one would want to have to go update all their source code to have full URLs in it
-->

---

# Import Maps

<!--
  So that leads us to import maps. Import maps allow us to say "this bare import specifier MAPS to this URL"
  and that gives us the best of both worlds. we can keep our clean and versionless import statements, but also make it work in browsers that need URLs
  To update Vue, we just need to update that mapping url and suddenly all our code will now import from the updated version automatically
-->

---

```json
{
  "import": {
    "vue": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.12/dist/vue.esm.browser.min.js"
  }
}
```

<!--
  and it just works. the libraries that are already bundling to ESM format *cough React cough* don't need to make any other changes for this to work
  and now we're also using the fast, efficient, beautiful ESM code built into browsers to resolve all our JS.
-->

---

## Browser status for Import Maps

- Chrome
- Edge

<!--
  that's obviously not good enough for now. so
-->

---

## Import map polyfill options:

    SystemJS
  </a>
- <a href="https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims" target="_blank">
    ES-Module-Shims
  </a>

<!--
  note: this solutions have their downsides as well! SystemJS still requires you to do some compilation in a bundler. but since almost everyone is already using bundlers to compile stuff, this doesn't actually count as a negative :D
  es module shims has some performance issues due to how it rewrites things in the browser
-->

---

## So... microfrontends (MFEs)?

<!--
  whew. we made it. believe it or not, that was the hardest part of understanding a certain type of MFE
  what do I mean by certain type?
-->

<!--
  The type of MFE that I am focusing on today is completely Clide-Side. We want to either fully utilize (or use polyfills) for browser standards and have MFEs tie it all together on the client.
  This allows us to use those nice SPA frameworks while also doing microservice-y stuff. Let's dig in
-->

---

## Remember Import Maps?

<br />

```js
import Vue from "vue";
```

<br />

```json
{
  "import": {
    "vue": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.12/dist/vue.esm.browser.min.js"
  }
}
```

<!--
  It it simply mapping the 'vue' keyword to a URL, which happens to be a CDN location of a JS file
-->

---

# You probably do this

<br />

```js
import { Button } from "@company/styleguide";
```

<br />
<Appear>

But with an Import Map!

```json
{
  "import": {
    "@company/styleguide": "cdn.com/company/styleguide.js"
  }
}
```

</Appear>

---

# That's not so different

...is it?

<!--
  You write your code the exact same way for the MFE setup as for a more traditional "create an NPM package for your styleguide" way
  the difference is... it's now being downloaded and resolved in the browser - NOT by a bundler.

  again, in the browser.
-->

---

# ...So what?

<!--
  it may not seem like a big deal. and honestly it isn't! but that one change is what allows you to now do MFEs
  it makes the dev experience better, and it makes updates to your apps faster.
-->

---

## Update Process

<br />

Traditional NPM way:

1. **Update library code (PR = manual work)**
1. Publish new library version to npm (CI = automated)
1. **Install new library version to app code (npm/yarn = manual work)**
1. **Update app code (PR = manual work)**
1. Deploy app (CI = automated)

<br />

<Appear>

Import map way:

1. **Update library code (PR = manual work)**
1. Publish new library version to CDN (CI = automated)
1. Update import map (CI = automated)

</Appear>

---

## Dev Process

<br />

Traditional NPM way:

1. Run app
1. Run styleguide
1. `yarn link` / `npm link` / `yalc link`
1. Build styleguide so the app sees the change

<br />

<Appear>

Import map way:

1. Run styleguide
1. Change import map

</Appear>

---

## Change import map?

<Appear>

```json
{
  "import": {
    "@company/styleguide": "http://localhost:8080/main.js"
  }
}
```

</Appear>

<!--
  remember it's just a mapper from a bare import specifier to a url
  and that url can be localhost if you need it to be!

  you don't have to run the app at all if you don't need to, since its entry in the import map is still pointing at the CDN
-->

---

# That's all there is to MFEs

<br />

Note: _client-side MFEs using import maps_

<!--
  client-side composition of MFEs using import maps... really isn't that strange. or different. is it?
  even better, doing it this way - it's an actual browser standard. by using import maps, you're "using the platform"

  As opposed to webpack's module federation (which is good, btw, no shade here) - it's not a standard, and it only works in webpack

  We want to be building on browser standards
-->

  alt="Shows three columns; each column relates to a specific type of 'Microfrontend (MFE) Composition'. Column one is 'Client-Side Composition' and shows MFEs being put together at the client/browser level. Column two shows 'Edge-Side Composition' with MFEs being composed at an Edge/CDN location. Column three shows 'Server-Side composition' with MFEs being assembled at the server/origin."
/>

<!--
  Remember, this is just one variant. There are other ways of doing MFEs, even if you're only looking at client-side composition!

  There are lots of other ways to do MFEs on edge-side and server-side!
-->

---

# single-spa

_A Javascript router for MFEs_

<!--
  A clients-side router usually just says "when at this route, mount this component"
  That's what single-spa does! Execpt, we can do it at a higher level: "when at this route, mount this APPLICATION"
